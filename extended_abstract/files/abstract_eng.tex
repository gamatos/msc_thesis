%\section*{Abstract}
We use geometric quantization and generalized coherent state transforms to determine how the ground state quantum Hall wave functions defined on a surface change as it undergoes an $S^1$-invariant deformation. This deformation is induced by the complexified flow of an $S^1$-invariant Hamiltonian vector field. We examine both the case of an infinite plane and of an infinite cylinder, both seen as toric KÃ¤hler manifolds. We find that, in both cases, the evolution does not significantly alter the structure of the single particle states and integer quantum Hall states. For fractional quantum Hall states, however, the polynomial structure is fundamentally changed, possibly reflecting the way that the Coulomb interaction between particles is affected by the change in the background geometry. In the case of the cylinder, in the limit of infinite imaginary time, the wave functions approximate distributional states concentrated on Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves. We compare some of these results with the existing literature.
