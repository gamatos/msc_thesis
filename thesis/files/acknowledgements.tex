\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, and foremost, I thank Professor José Mourão for mentoring me and for thoroughly supporting me during the time I have worked with him. His availability and willingness to help were incredible. He was always a truly exceptional, caring, and outstanding advisor.

I thank, and cherish, all the friends I have made throughout the years I have spent studying mathematics, and the time I have spent with them. My stay at Instituto Superior Técnico would not have been the same without their company and encouragement.

I thank all the professors that I have had the privilege of studying under. Their overall quality and knowledge was remarkable, and I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to learn from them.

Finally, I thank the support given by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation through the fellowship provided in the 2017-2018 edition of the \emph{Novos Talentos em Tecnologias Quânticas} program, and the support given by the Centre for Mathematical Analysis, Geometry, and Dynamical Systems (CAMGSD) through the BIL fellowship nr. 20423246.
